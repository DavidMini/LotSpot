# LotSpot / Team-21

## Iteration 02

* Start date: February 16, 2017
 * End date: March 9, 2017

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction

#### Roles & responsibilities

We split our group into front end and back end. The front end of the group was to build the google maps api and add markers for parking lot locations, as well as additional information once markers were selected. The backend group was to create the server on which we are able to send information from our parking lots to the front end.


We also created several issues on github to keep track of who is responsible for which features.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

* When and where? In-person or online?
We had meeting twice a week in person each one hour long, the first meeting on mondays from 1pm-2pm and the second was during our tutorial on thursday from 2pm-3pm possibly extending a little bit later. We also arranged and planned some things over slack.

* What's the purpose of each meeting?
UML design of our function calls -
Our meetings we decided what platform we are building our application, we went through several ideas and struggled a little bit to decide how we were going to cultivate our ideas. We finally decided to make a native android application, using google maps api to help us with the workload. Our next meeting we discussed a script for our video and how we were going to film it. We had an additional meeting to film our video.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

* Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
We did not use as many artifacts as we would have liked to, Much of our planning and organization was oral or through our slack server. However we did use some github issues to denote important tasks.
* We want to understand:
  * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
GitHub issues and communicating with one another over slack/in person.
  * How do you prioritize tasks?
MVP features were focused on during this phase, We had several additional ideas that we noted but are not going to begin implementing until the MVP features are working.
  * How do tasks get assigned to team members?
We discussed it in our meetings and found who was comfortable doing what.

#### Git / GitHub workflow


We partly used pull requests to verify that we wouldn’t run into conflicts, we had some peer evaluation. But for majority of the project we did not run into issues manipulating the same branch.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

- Front end interface
* Interface and front end tools to be able to make a good looking demo video.

- json server starter.

#### Artifacts

For the video we plan to make an animation for the introduction and closure. As for the demonstration of the product we plan to use a screencapture of its use. We had also discussed making a live video of a first hand experience using the application.
