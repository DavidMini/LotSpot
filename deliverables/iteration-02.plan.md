# LotSpot / Team-21

## Iteration 02

* Start date: February 16, 2017
* End date: March 9, 2017

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

We split our group into front end and back end. The front end of the group was to build the google maps api and add markers for parking lot locations, as well as additional information once markers were selected. The backend group was to create the server on which we are able to send information from our parking lots to the front end.

We also created several issues on github to keep track of who is responsible for which features.

#### Events

We had meeting twice a week in person each one hour long, the first meeting on mondays from 1pm-2pm and the second was during our tutorial on thursday from 2pm-3pm possibly extending a little bit later. We also arranged and planned some things over slack.

UML design of our function calls -
Our meetings we decided what platform we are building our application, we went through several ideas and struggled a little bit to decide how we were going to cultivate our ideas. We finally decided to make a native android application, using google maps api to help us with the workload. Our next meeting we discussed a script for our video and how we were going to film it. We had an additional meeting to film our video.

#### Artifacts

We did not use as many artifacts as we would have liked to, Much of our planning and organization was oral or through our slack server. However, we did use some github issues to denote important tasks.

We use GitHub issues and communicate with one another over slack and in person to keep track of the tasks need to be done.

When assigning tasks, we prioritize our key MVP features over additional ones. MVP features were focused on during this phase, We had several additional ideas that we noted but are not going to begin implementing until the MVP features are working.

We discussed about task assignments explicitly during our meetings (online and in person) and every member will pick the tasks they feel comfortable and confident doing.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Every member forks the repo. From each branch to the master branch, we use pull requests to verify that we wouldn’t run into conflicts. The pull requests are reviewed and merged by the group leader. We also have some peer evaluation. For majority of the project we did not run into issues manipulating the same branch.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

- Front end interface
* Interface and front end tools to be able to make a good looking demo video.
* These elements include, Custom Map Markers, sliding menus, list of nearby parking lots, filter options menu, additional information slab when clicking on a parking lot marker.
- animated video introduction and closure.
- iteration and review documentation.
- json server starter.

#### Artifacts

For the video we plan to make an animation for the introduction and closure. As for the demonstration of the product we plan to use a screencapture of its use. We had also discussed making a live video of a first hand experience using the application.
