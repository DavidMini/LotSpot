## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 23, 2017
 * Where: Physical location BA2185 and BA2170 1pm to 3pm

## Decisions that turned out well

More collaborative tasks
  - We identified tasks that have a high work load and assign it to multiple people. This helped a great deal with workflow, we were able to reduce errors and time developing time sensitive functionality.
  - With the list-view task, we assigned Wen De and Hugh so we can garuntee its development for this phase.
  
Github Issues
 - Assigned one person to delegate and close issues on Github (Bogdan).
 - This helped organize ourselves and minimized overhead for most members since the previous method was a free for all.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

Bug Catching
 - Although we thought we were thorough and had peer reviews of one another's code, we still found many logic bugs that needed fixing when we had hoped to already move on to another task.
 - We would like to change our approach in future iterations. Specifically by incorporating more intuitive testing upon our code. 


### Planned changes

More vigorous bug catching
 - Mandatory attempt to break all the features we implement more vigorously. We will not bother with creating test cases as it is very time consuming, however, we planned to incorporate feature testing during peer review sessions.
 - Feature testing will include a "Quality Assurance" session where group members will become testers and will try to break the code by using the application. The structure is informal but the idea is to incorprate these sessions within our already planned peer review sessions.
 - We are making this change so that we limit the number of bugs that pop up when we are working on a new task. We are on a tight schedule and do not have much time for back tracking on our workflow.


## Product - Review

These are features that we were able to complete for this iteration
 - List of parking lots view slide from the right side
 - Parking lot API
 - Running server/database for our parking lots
 - Fixed several bugs such as search bar issues and additional information pannel at the bottom not being removed.
 - Current location is now displayed
 - Slight UI upgrade, new marker images are now easier to see.

## Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

Complete back and front end integration
 - This is a very general statement but it encompasses several goals/tasks
 - Although we have a API, server and database established, we were not able to completely integrate the server to all the functionality of the front end. This means certain features such as the listview and and marker info boxes are missing dynamic data. Those features are ready to speak to our back end, however, there is some handling that needs to be finished on the server side before this is done.
 
Additional UI styling
 - Map theme change.
 - After some review and advice from our TA, color and some minor style changes will be added.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

Increase focus on Bug finding
 - More thorough peer review, perhaps having new issues that include bug handling, example: when an issue is closed we open a new issue called bug test (feature)
Our UI is not very good and needs a revamp
 - Several of our assets and current design decisions are not intuitive. We would like our application to be easy to use (common sense) so we need to rethink our layout and UI styling.
Our workflow is working
 - Asside from bugs being a bit time consuming, our new workflow (with Github issues) is working well. We should continue with this plan and make adjustments as they are needed.
