## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 23, 2017
 * Where: Physical location BA2185 and BA2170 1pm to 3pm

## Decisions that turned out well

More collaborative tasks
  - This helped a great deal with workflow, we were able to complete a task that had a larger workflow.
  - With List task completed sooner we could work on additional features that require or implement it.
  
Github Issues
 - assign one person to delegate and close issues.
 - this helped organize ourselves and minimized overhead for most members.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

Bug Catching
 - although we thought we were thorough and had peer review of one another's code we still found many bugs that needed fixing when we had hoped to be able to move on to another task.
 - We would like to change our approach in future iterations.


### Planned changes

More vigorous bug catching
 - try and break all the features we implement more vigorously to catch bugs earlier in the development so they are not issues later when we are exploring other tasks.
 - we are making this change so that we do not run into a similar issue where we are working on a new task and find that we have issues because of a bug with a previous task.


## Product - Review

 - list of parking lots view slide from the right side
 - API
 - server
 - fixed several bugs such as search bar issues, and additional information pannel at the bottom not being removed.
 - current location
 - UI upgrade, new marker images that are easier to see.

## Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

Complete back and front end integration
 - although we have a API, server and database established we were not able to completely integrate the server to all the functionality of the front end.
 
Additional UI styling
 - map theme change.
 - after some review and advice from our TA color and some minor style changes.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

Increase focus on Bug finding
 - more thorough peer review, perhaps having new issues that include bug handling, example: when an issue is closed we open a new issue called bug test (feature)
