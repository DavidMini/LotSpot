	- Decided on slack for mondays at 1-2pm.
	- Thursday 1-2pm
	- additional meetings planned through slack as needed.
- Come up with several concepts for our product
	- Group meeting we discussed our product ideas. Jan 30, 2017 (first meeting)


 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

- Mockup
	- Show UI for the application.
	- app navigation.
	- show features.


 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
