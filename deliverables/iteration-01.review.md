# Team21 - LotSpot!

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: February 6, 2017 & February 9, 2017
 * Where: BA3200 and BA2195

## Process - Reflection



#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- Outlining multiple ideas and getting feedback from our TA before making a decision.
	- This changed our direction from our original ideas but gave us a more concrete focus.
- Research similar products
	- This helped us notice what idea's had already been done in exess and helped narrow down our problem and user base.
- Using slack for communication.
	- Showed to be very useful tool to communicate.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

- We were originally set on doing a parking lot sharing application, but after getting some insight from our TA we found the market was over 
	saturated with similar applications.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)


 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- Come up with a product that solves a specific problem
	- we came up with several and narrowed our focus to one we are happy with.
- List of MVP features for our application
	- features that are essential to create a minimal viable product.
- Navigation and User Interface
	- mock example of user interface.

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
	
- Persona's
	- We wanted to make several user personas but never completed them.
	- Our target users is very broad, many with vehicles, although we came up with several concepts we left this as a lower priority.

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- Focus on organization and structure.
	- What tools/language we are using to create the application.
		- making sure everyone has their environment set up.
	- Dividing up workload.
	- How we will organize work flow. Kanban, Scrum or some sort of hybrid.
- Making github issues that we will use to track small, and some large milestones.
	- This is very important so we can keep track of our progress, we will try to create many small tasks and organize them by importance by assigning each
	task a value for urgency/importance (scale of 1 to 5, 1 being urgent and important). As well as breaking up the workload and assigning members to issues.
	
 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
