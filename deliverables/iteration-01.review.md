# Team21 - LotSpot!

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: February 6, 2017 & February 9, 2017
 * Where: BA3200 and BA2195

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- Outlining multiple ideas and getting feedback from our TA before making a decision.
	- This changed our direction from our original ideas but gave us a more concrete focus.
- Research similar products
	- This helped us notice what idea's had already been done in excess and helped narrow down our problem and user base.
- Using slack for communication.
	- Showed to be very useful tool to communicate.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

- We were originally set on doing a parking lot sharing application, but after getting some insight from our TA we found the market was over 
	saturated with similar applications.

- Organizational tools such as trello over complicated our workflow process. We decided on toning down the amount of tools we use to keep
	things simple and organized. In trello's case we will be using Github issues instead.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

- We are deciding to change our target user. Originally we were targeting any downtown commuter, but that is very generic. Instead we will be focusing
	on individuals driving downtown for events. 

- To match the new target audience we need to change our personas. Our new personas are interested in using our application exclusively during events, so
	we will change their tasks to fit this new role. 


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- Come up with a product that solves a specific problem
	- we came up with several and narrowed our focus to one we are happy with.
- List of MVP features for our application
	- features that are essential to create a minimal viable product.
- Navigation and User Interface
	- mock example of user interface.
	

 * Proof for the goals/tasks can be found in the product.md file

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
	
- Persona's
	- We wanted to make several user personas but never completed them.
	- Our target users is very broad, many with vehicles, although we came up with several concepts we left this as a lower priority.

 - UI features
 	- We came up with some ideas for how to display information and how functionality can work
	- These are technical questions that will come back up once we begin application development, so we are holding them off for now

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- Focus on organization and structure.
	- What tools/language we are using to create the application.
		- making sure everyone has their environment setup.
	- Dividing up workload.
	- How we will organize work flow. Kanban, Scrum or some sort of hybrid.
- Making github issues that we will use to track small, and some large milestones.
	- This is very important so we can keep track of our progress, we will try to create many small tasks and organize them by importance by assigning each
	task a value for urgency/importance (scale of 1 to 5, 1 being urgent and important). As well as breaking up the workload and assigning members to issues.
