# Team21 - LotSpot!

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 - When: February 6, 2017 & February 9, 2017
 - Where: BA3200 and BA2195

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

- Outlined multiple ideas and got feedback from TA before eventually making a decision
	- This changed our direction from our original ideas but gave us a more concrete focus
	
- Researched for similar products
	- This helped us notice what ideas had already been done in excess and helped narrow down our problem and user base
	
- Used Slack for team communication
	- Slack turned out to be a very useful tool for online collaboration

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Parking lot sharing idea
	- We were originally set on doing a parking lot sharing application, but after getting some insights from our TA we realized that the market was already oversaturated with similar applications so we decided it would be better to aim for a different direction

- Organizational tools
	- Organizational tools, such as trello, overcomplicated our workflow process. We decided to tone down the amount of tools we use to keep things simple and organized. In trello's case we will be using Github issues instead.

#### Planned changes

- Target users
	- We are deciding to change our target users. Originally we were targeting any downtown commuter, but that is very generic. Instead we will be focusing on individuals driving downtown for events. 

- Personas
	- To match the new target users, we need to change our personas as well. Our new personas would be interested in using our application exclusively during events, so we will modify their tasks to fit their new roles.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- Came up with a product that solves a specific problem
	- We came up with several product ideas
	- We narrowed our focus down to one we are happy with, aka the parking lot recommending application
	
- Produced list of MVP features for our application
	- Identified key features that are essential to create a minimal viable product
	
- Produced UI Mockup
	- Produced a mockup version of the user interface
	- Mockup shows basic app components, features and navigation

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
	
- Personas
	- We wanted to create several user personas but haven't completed all of them
	- Our target users are very broad, many with vehicles, although we came up with several concepts we left this as a lower priority task

 - UI features
 	- We came up with some ideas for how to display information and how functionality can work
	- These are technical questions that will come back up once we begin application development, so we are holding them off for now

## Meeting Highlights

- Focus on organizations and structures
	- What tools/language we are using to create the application
		- Make sure everyone has their environment setup
	- Divide up workload depending on each member's role, experience and current workload
		- This makes us more efficient as a team
	- How we will organize work flow: Kanban, Scrum or some sort of hybrid
		- Decide on a plan that works for everyone so that we can stick to the model
	
- Make use of Github issues to track small, and some large milestones
	- This is very important so we can keep track of our progress. We will try to create many small tasks and organize them by importance by assigning each task a numerical value for urgency/importance (scale of 1 to 5, 1 being urgent and important), as well as breaking up the workload and assigning members to different issues.
