## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

* When: March 8, 2017
* Where: Physical meeting UofT BA3200 

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


- Bi-weekly in person meetings
        - This kept us focused on our task and that we were on track to meet our deadline.
- CRC Cards
- Used to plan our data structure and classes, was quick and effective.  
- Github Issues
- Shows each team member's responsibilities.
- Helped us keep track of priority tasks.
- Slack server
        - Constant communication helped us organize ourselves.



* 2 - 4 decisions.
* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped.

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.


We planned too many tasks and our overhead was too large for this phase.


We also had spent a lot of time setting up our environment, something we did not account for.

* 2 - 4 decisions.
* Ordered from most to least important.
* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

-Introduce peer review once a week, or after issues are resolved.
        - Peer review merges, and pull requests done by other members.
        - Work in pairs on tasks once video recording is complete.
        - We are choosing to do this to cut down on time spent fixing issues.
-A more concrete plan for progressing our program development.
        - Our past github issues were too broad, more specific specifications.

* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

-Google Map implemented.
-Markers and Interfaces for parking lots created.
-Search bar.
-Logo and Animated Video introduction.
-Additional information on clicking lot marker.

* From most to least important.
* Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
* If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.




#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
-Filter parking lot menu.
-Listing of nearby parking lots on search.
-Additional UI styling

* From most to least important.
* For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
  e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:


-We need more concrete specifications for our tasks.
        - To help keep all team members on track.
        - Cut down on overhead of long discussions of implementation.
-Implement factory design pattern.
- For android have factory pattern of models that helps us create views.
-MVC model implementation.
- This can assist our workflow, in context of an android application.
