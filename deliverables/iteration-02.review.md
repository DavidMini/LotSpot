#LotSpot team-21

> _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
>      
> _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

* When: March 8, 2017
* Where: Physical meeting UofT BA3200 

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


- Bi-weekly in person meetings
        - This kept us focused on our task and that we were on track to meet our deadline.
- CRC Cards
        - Used to plan our data structure and classes. Was quick, effective, and kept everyone on the same page.
- Github Issues
        - Shows each team member's responsibilities.
        - Helped us keep track of priority tasks.
- Slack server
        - Constant communication helped us organize tasks and meetings between ourselves.



* 2 - 4 decisions.
* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped.

* List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.


- We planned too many tasks and our overhead was too large for this phase. As a result we had to cut down on the amount of implementation needed for the demo


- We also had spent a lot of time setting up our environments, something we did not account for. This played a role in why some features were not completed for this phase and it caused unnecesary stress in the group.

* 2 - 4 decisions.
* Ordered from most to least important.
* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

-Introduce peer review at least once a week.
        - Peer review major merges, and pull requests done by other members.
        - Pair front end members with back end members according to their task assignment. A front end feature using back end data should have both developers making design decision to make it intuitive.
        - We are choosing to do this to cut down on time spent fixing issues and descrepencies between code.
-A more concrete plan for progressing our program development.
        - Our past github issues were too broad, more specific specifications are needed.
        - Introduce a second task keeper to make sure all git hub issues are being resolve on time (responsibility is to much for just one person).

* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

-Animated Video demo.
-Google Map implemented.
-Markers and Interfaces for parking lots created.
-Search bar.
-Additional information on clicking lot marker.
-List view which currently displays the options for filtering
-Logo

* From most to least important.
* Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
* If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.




#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
-Front/Back end integration
        -A lot of work is being done in the back end so it hasn't been fully developed yet (due to time). The current data being displayed is all static.
-Accounts for parking lot managers
        -This is a new idea that we added. After discussing it, it makes sense for lot owners to have accounts. However, this decision was made to late to be added into this phase.
-Filter parking lots by occupancy.
        -Requires integration with back end
-List view of parking lots
        -The group members assigned with this task were also assigned with video development. They understandably didn't have enough time to add this feature.
-Additional UI styling
        -This is the first iteration of our project. We will have to go through several UI designs before we are happy with the styling of the application.

* From most to least important.
* For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
  e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:


-We need more concrete specifications for our tasks.
        - To help keep all team members on track.
        - Cut down on overhead of long discussions of implementation.
-Implement factory design pattern.
        - For android, having a factory pattern of models helps us create views.
-MVC model implementation.
        - This can assist our workflow, in context of an android application and our idea requiring hardware speaking with our server.   

* 2 - 4 items
* Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
* High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
* These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
* Can be related to product and/or process.
