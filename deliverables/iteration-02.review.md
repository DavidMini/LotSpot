#LotSpot team-21

> _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
>      
> _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

* When: March 8, 2017
* Where: Physical meeting UofT BA3200 

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

- Bi-weekly in person meetings          
  This kept us focused on our task and that we were on track to meet our deadline.

- CRC Cards     
  Used to plan our data structure and classes. Was quick, effective, and kept everyone on the same page.
        
- Github Issues         
        - Shows each team member's responsibilities.    
        - Helped us keep track of priority tasks.
        
- Slack server          
        - Constant communication helped us organize tasks and meetings between ourselves.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped.

- We planned too many tasks and our overhead was too large for this phase. As a result we had to cut down on the amount of implementation needed for the demo


- We also had spent a lot of time setting up our environments, something we did not account for. This played a role in why some features were not completed for this phase and it caused unnecesary stress in the group.

#### Planned changes

- Introduce peer review at least once a week.           
        - Peer review major merges, and pull requests done by other members.            
        - Pair front end members with back end members according to their task assignment. A front end feature using back end data should have both developers making design decision to make it intuitive.             
        - We are choosing to do this to cut down on time spent fixing issues and descrepencies between code.            
        
- A more concrete plan for progressing our program development.         
        - Our past github issues were too broad, more specific specifications are needed.       
        - Introduce a second task keeper to make sure all git hub issues are being resolve on time (responsibility is to much for just one person).

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- Animated Video demo.
- Google Map implemented.
- Markers and Interfaces for parking lots created.
- Search bar.
- Additional information on clicking lot marker.
- List view which currently displays the options for filtering
- Logo

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
- Front/Back end integration            
        - A lot of work is being done in the back end so it hasn't been fully developed yet (due to time). The current data being displayed is all static.
        
- Accounts for parking lot managers             
        - This is a new idea that we added. After discussing it, it makes sense for lot owners to have accounts. However, this decision was made to late to be added into this phase.
        
- Filter parking lots by occupancy              
        - Requires integration with back end
        
- List view of parking lots             
  The group members assigned with this task were also assigned with video development. They understandably didn't have enough time to add this feature.
  
- Additional UI styling         
  This is the first iteration of our project. We will have to go through several UI designs before we are happy with the styling of the application.

## Meeting Highlights

- We need more concrete specifications for our tasks.           
        - To help keep all team members on track.       
        - Cut down on overhead of long discussions of implementation.
- Implement factory design pattern.             
        - For android, having a factory pattern of models helps us create views.
- MVC model implementation.             
        - This can assist our workflow, in context of an android application and our idea requiring hardware speaking with our server.
