## Demo
Welcome to LotSpot!
	
As we open LotSpot, notice there are no sign ups and no other unnecessary overhead. We are jumping straight into the application. 

As you may see, there are several markers that populate the map. The markers are colored Red, Orange, and Green. They also have a number representing the amount of available spots in the parking lot. The color of the marker is to give the user a quick visual representation of how full the lot is. Green has an abundant number of available spots, orange is moderate, and red is full or nearly full. 

Now let's go somewhere. We have implemented a search option at the top of the screen to easily navigate to where we wish to find a parking space. We search Toronto, as bob would like to go to the art gallery of Toronto for an event. From here he can see there are two lots nearby one is almost completely full indicated by the red marker, with only 1 lot available, however we can see there is another lot that has many available spaces. When we select the lot we get additional information at the bottom of the screen.

On our backend we have Parking lot owners accounts, these accounts are simple with information including lot address, lot capacity, accessibility options, cost, and a few other specifications.

Additionally bob will be able to see a list of nearby parking locations, that can be filtered and ranked by given specifications such as cost, distance, and accessibility, so that Bob can plan his trip even better. But that’s not the end of it! “What else,” you ask? Check out our new cool features which will be implemented in the next iteration!
